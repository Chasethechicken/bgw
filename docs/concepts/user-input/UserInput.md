# User Input

The BGW framework uses events to communicate user input to Components. 
To execute code when a specific event is fired, a function reference, or a function literal can be set in 
[ComponentView][CompDoc]s.
If components can be enabled for drag and drop some additional handlers can be set. 
Components can be enabled for drag and drop whenever they extend 
[DynamicComponentView](https://tudo-aqua.github.io/bgw/kotlin-docs/bgw-core/tools.aqua.bgw.components/-component-view/index.html).

For a more detailed introduction for Drag and Drop head [here](https://tudo-aqua.github.io/bgw/concepts/drag-and-drop/DragAndDropExample.html).
